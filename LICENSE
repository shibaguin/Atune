Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

The GNU Lesser General Public License is a free software license published by the
Free Software Foundation (FSF). It is a more permissive license than the GNU General
Public License (GPL) and is designed primarily for software libraries. This License
allows developers and companies to use and integrate the Library into their own
software (even proprietary software) without being required to release the source code
of their non-library components. However, any modifications to the Library itself must
be released under the terms of this License.

You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License along with
this Library; if not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

0. Definitions.

   “This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
   “The Library” means a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application
   or a Combined Work as defined below.
   “A Covered Work” is either the Library or any work that incorporates a portion of the
   Library.
   “Modified Version” means any work containing the Library or a portion of it, either
   unmodified or with modifications, and in which the Library is recast or recombined
   with other code not covered by this License.
   “Combined Work” means a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library.
   “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed,
   in a reasonable time and without undue burden, to copy, modify, and reinstall the work,
   including the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the object code.
      
1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU General Public License.

   You may convey a Covered Work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being
   bound by section 3 of the GNU General Public License, provided that you include a
   written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party the Corresponding
   Source of the Library in accordance with this License.

2. Conveying Modified Versions.

   You may modify your copy of the Library, and you may distribute a Modified Version, provided that:
     a) The Modified Version is itself a Covered Work, and is licensed under the terms of this License;
     b) You clearly mark the files that you have changed, and the date of any change;
     c) You license the Modified Version, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy;
     d) You provide, with each copy of the Modified Version, a copy of this License; and
     e) The Modified Version must include prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

3. Object Code Conveyance.

   You may distribute the object code form of a Modified Version under terms of your choice,
   provided that you also distribute the Corresponding Source of the Library and any scripts
   used to control compilation and installation of the object code. The distribution must be
   in a form that enables the user to modify the Library and to recombine it with other software.

4. Combined Works.

   You may combine the Library with other code to produce a Combined Work, and distribute the
   Combined Work under terms of your choice, provided that:
     a) The terms of your distribution permit modification of the portions of the Combined Work
        that come from the Library; and
     b) The user is able to replace or modify the Library portion in the Combined Work, for example
        by providing the Necessary Corresponding Source for the Library.

5. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General
   Public License from time to time. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
   specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License “or any later version”
   applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or
   of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY,
WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE LIBRARY
